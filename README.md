# 👋 ¡Hola! I'm **Abraham**

## 🔍 About Me  
I’m a **Data Analyst Lead** who loves turning messy, real-world data into clean, scalable systems that actually drive business decisions.  

At **Tubaa Tech**, I work across multiple departments to **clean, model, and automate business data**  everything from receipts, payrolls, and service logs to budget reports. I build **data pipelines, models, and warehouses** that keep operations running smoothly.  

💡 My stack blends **SQL**, **Advanced Excel** (Power Query, VBA, Power Pivot), **Python**, and **Power BI** with a touch of storytelling in reporting.  
I’ve:  
- Harmonized **3+ years** of scattered operational data 
- Built custom **reporting templates** & **category systems** for analysis  
- Automated **data entry → insights pipelines**  
- Set up **data flows** that now guide how the company operates  

I think like an **analyst** but also like a **systems builder** ensuring data isn’t just *available*, but *usable* and *accessible* for everyone (finance, ops, or management).  

🚀 Currently diving deeper into **full-stack analytics** and **data engineering** with a growing love for **Microsoft Fabric** and **cloud data systems**.  

Let’s connect if you’re into **practical, ground-level data work** that actually makes an impact.
