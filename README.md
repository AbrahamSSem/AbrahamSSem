ðŸ‘‹ I'm Abraham and I work as a data analytics lead with a strong focus on structuring messy, real-world data into usable, scalable systems that drive decisions. Currently at Al Nahar Integrated Services, I work across multiple departments (Contracting, Garage, IT) to clean, model, and automate business data â€” from data entry of receipts and payroll to service records and budget reports.

My approach combines Advanced Excel (Power Query, VBA, Power Pivot), Python, SQL and storytelling through reporting. Iâ€™ve led internal projects to harmonize 3+ years of disconnected operational data, built custom reporting templates, created category systems for analysis, and set up data flows that now guide how the company operates moving forward.

I think like an analyst but also like a systems builder always making sure data is not just available but usable by everyone, easy to access, whether it's finance, operations, or management.

Currently growing toward full-stack analytics and data engineering, with interest in Microsoft Fabric, cloud systems, and retail analytics. Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re into practical, ground-level data work that makes a real difference.
