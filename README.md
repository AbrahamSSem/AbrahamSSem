👋 I'm Abraham and I work as a data and analytics lead with a strong focus on structuring messy, real-world data into usable, scalable systems that drive decisions. Currently atTubaa Tech, I work across multiple departments to clean, model, and automate business data — from data entry of receipts and payroll, service records and budget reports to building analytical data pipelines and datawarehouses.

My approach combines Advanced Excel (Power Query, VBA, Power Pivot), Python, SQL and storytelling through reporting. I’ve led internal projects to harmonize 3+ years of disconnected operational data, built custom reporting templates, created category systems for analysis, and set up data flows that now guide how the company operates moving forward.

I think like an analyst but also like a systems builder always making sure data is not just available but usable by everyone, easy to access, whether it's finance, operations, or management.

Currently growing toward full-stack analytics and data engineering, with interest in Microsoft Fabric and cloud systems. Let’s connect if you’re into practical, ground-level data work that makes a real difference.
